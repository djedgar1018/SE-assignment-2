SE-Assignment2 – Version Control using GitHub
Overview

This repository was created for CINS 5318 – Software Engineering (Fall 2025) as part of Assignment #2: Version Control using GitHub.
The purpose of this assignment is to learn and demonstrate basic Git and GitHub commands for version control and collaboration.

Features Implemented

Initial commit with a simple “Hello, World!” program.

Created multiple branches for adding new features.

Used Pull Requests to merge features into the main branch.

Practiced collaboration workflow using reviews and merge approvals.

Updated this README to include project details and reflection.

Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SE-assignment2.git


Navigate into the directory:

cd SE-assignment2


Run the code file in your preferred language (for example):

python hello.py


View outputs and test new features.

Issues and Challenges

The main issue encountered during this assignment was a merge conflict that occurred when merging the feature-3 branch into the main branch.
The conflict happened because both branches modified the same section of code. The issue was resolved by manually reviewing both versions, combining the correct changes, committing the fix, and pushing the resolved merge back to GitHub.

Reflection

Using Git and GitHub for version control was helpful for understanding how real software teams manage collaboration.
The branching and pull request process made it clear how multiple contributors can safely work on the same project.
The merge conflict provided hands-on experience with resolving common problems developers face when collaborating.
